APP NAME - Revenant 

NATURAL DISASTER FOCCUSED - EARTHQUAKE. 

IDEA - *Predicting real-time earthquake with integrated wifi calling service.

TECHNOLOGY USED - AZURE BOT SERVICE, Raspberry Pi, AZURE FACE API, AZURE IOT HUB, Visual Studio, Accelerometer sensor, GitHub, Wifi.  

LANGUAGES USED -  Python 3.6, Java

DESCRIPTION - 
		
	1. Prediction of real-time earthquake -> An accelerometer sensor will be installed in the building along with Raspberry pi which will sense real-time vibrations and  will trigger the alarm on excedding the threshold. 
	2. Calling over local wifi network -> During the absence of network a person will be able to call anyone in a certain area limit for help through the app.  
	3. Face recognition-> Many children get lost in natural disasters, by this app we can find the information about anyone provided their face images and information is stored in the database. We will use the Azure Face API.

BENEFITS OF PROJECT -

	This app predicts and helps in prevention from earthquake. The prediction of earthquakes will be most helpful when earthquakes occur during night time. The wifi calling service will work even in absence of network which commonly occurs during earhquakes. The face recognition service will help in finding out the information about lost ones.
